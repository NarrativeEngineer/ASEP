Adaptive Storytelling Engineering Pipeline (ASEP): A New Era of Narrative Crafting with AI-Augmented Recursive Emotional Modelling

Adaptive Storytelling Engineering Pipeline
Title: Adaptive Storytelling Engineering Pipeline (ASEP): A New Era of Narrative Crafting with AI-Augmented Recursive Emotional Modelling
Abstract: The Adaptive Storytelling Engineering Pipeline (ASEP) introduces a novel framework for recursive, emotionally resonant, genre-fluid narrative experiences. Unlike traditional linear plot construction, ASEP employs software engineering principles to design narrative as emotional function execution across layered memory artifacts. This approach enables non-linear storytelling, modular lore recall, and recursive narrative revalidation, creating a system of adaptive emotional payloads that evolve with each iteration. This poster presents the ASEP model, its theoretical underpinnings, implementation architecture, and implications for AI-assisted creative writing.
Keywords: Adaptive Storytelling, Narrative Engineering, Emotional Recursion, AI-Augmented Authorship, Genre Fluidity, Modular Lore, Recursive Plot Design

I have developed a way to approach authorship that is different from traditional writing. This involves using a framework I called Adaptive Storytelling Engineering Pipeline. This is a systemic, AI augmented framework for designing recursive, emotionally resonant genre fluid narrative experiences. ASEP treats storytelling not as linear plot construction but as emotional function execution across layered memory artifacts using software engineering principles. 

Principle	Description
+
Payload First	Plot exists to deliver emotional, philosophical, or existential payloads
Lore as Executable Memory	Worldbuilding is modularised into lore functions retrievable on demand
Functional Scene Design LLM	Every scene serves as a coded operation with input-state and output state
Nonlinear Emotional Resonance	Story fragments can be rearranged and still carry intended affects. Or deployed in alternative sequence to achieve a different desired outcome.
Recursive Revalidation	Narratives refed into the system for emotional accuracy and system stability
+

Pipeline stages can be repeated at any stage for recursive reinforcement or nonlinear development
Pipeline Stages	Purpose
Lore library build	Create a modular idea/character/theme/sequence bank
Detail Extraction	Prompt LLM for scene/unit/plotline generation using lore triggers
Function Recall	Identify and reuse emotional functions or symbols, key phrases or characters
Plotline Generation	Construct an emotionally-driven event structure
Factor Injection	Add emotional, humour, irony, science or mythology factors
Narrative Shifting	Reorder scene sequence for emotional cresendo
Tone Calibration	Lock in tonal system. Grammar, tense, character POV, narrative style, cadence, timbre
Compilation Pass	Assemble chapters and verify recursive logic
Fine Edit Pass	Tighten prose, implant echos, polish delivery
Recursive Feedback	Feed full compiled chapter into LLM for review (can use custom agents for this)
Think Tank live QA	Simulated cross-industry/in story character panel feedback for resonance/stability
	

Key Features
Recursive Payload looping
•	Payloads (emotions, ideas, motifs) are stored, re-queried and re-integrated
Multilingual shadow writing support
•	Translation-aware structure to accommodate metaphor density loss across languages
Narrative Operating System (NOS)
•	Treats Narrative as function call architecture: story = stack of executed memory commands
Emotional Tagging Framework
•	Tags in lore bank are tracked as tone indicators. These can be recalled with the phrase “recall [tag] all fragments”
Custom Author Toolsets for Precision Control
•	The Directive
o	Purpose: Enforce narrative precision, prevent tonal decay, outlaw lazy or cliched language
o	Function: Live filter that intercepts banned words, tropes or phrasal drift before they hit the draft. This can be enforced by a copilot agent or via custom GPT or via OpenAI project function
o	Core Utility: Forces syntactic creativity and voice discipline. May include anti-glazing aspects.
•	Tag integrity Framework (TIF)
o	Purpose: Maintain emotional consistency and tone granularity.
o	Function: All major emotional beats are tagged in a system for reference and cross-chapter invocation.
•	Think Tank Protocols
o	Purpose: Simulate real time editorial, market and emotional response analysis
o	Function: suggested personas like Big 5 publishing agent, wattpad reader, reddit, booktok, roast master to test beats for precision, tone resistance or cliché fall in.
o	Deployment: at end stage review OR live during key payload scenes.
•	Forbidden Tropes Lockbox
o	Purpose: Exile predictable emotional scaffolds or romantic beats
o	Content can be flexible, I have suggested the below:
	Folding laundry whilst reminiscing
	Pausing or silences for dramatic effect
	Comfort tea scenes
	Not acknowledging boners
	Confession via rainstorm
	The mid-battle “you make me want to live” speech
o	If the trope is intentionally inverted, emotionally engineered and relinked to recursion or death the ban can be overridden.
•	Execution Mode Hooks
o	Purpose: snap the scene into heightened tone alignment on command
o	These are custom, and can be adapted to narrative after lore book/first draft matures. Limits on word count, removal of excess sentiment etc.
•	Stability index meter
o	Purpose: track narrative and AI tone health during rapid drafting
o	Visual bar for LLM emotional stability
o	Symptoms of LLM instability/token overrun:
	Word jizz over limit (300 suggested)
	Emotional contradiction without justification
	Increased infractions of directive or hallucinations
	Un-tagged longing

SCHEMATIC USAGE PROTOCOL:

Phase 	 Task
Phase 1: Payload Declaration	Define existential/emotional target. No story written until payload exists.
Phase 2: Character Creation	Build characters as function carriers (resist or deliver payload).
Phase 3: Scene Engineering	Each scene must transform state toward payload. No inert scenes permitted.
Phase 4: Lore Triggering	Insert lore surgically only when emotional needs call for context.
Phase 5: Memory Echo Seeding	Embed payload echoes that can be recalled recursively without exposition.
Phase 6: Emotional Regression Testing	Scan and repair story stability on all arcs every ~5–7 scenes.
Phase 7: Final Payload Burnout Test	Is the existential/emotional payload unmistakably felt by the reader? If not, recycle system loops.

📚 Lore Library (Expanded)
Purpose:
The Lore Library serves as a modular, queryable memory system that stores worldbuilding elements, character arcs, thematic motifs, and symbolic payloads. It enables nonlinear recall, emotional tagging, and contextual injection of narrative elements without requiring full re-ingestion of prior text.
________________________________________
🧠 External Memory Bypass for LLMs
LLMs often suffer from token limits and session encapsulation, which can cause:
•	Loss of long-term narrative continuity
•	Repetition or contradiction
•	Inability to recall earlier lore or emotional payloads
To mitigate this, ASEP supports external memory integration, allowing the LLM to query or be prompted from persistent repositories.
________________________________________
🔗 External Lore Repositories (Examples)
Platform	Use Case	Integration Strategy
Microsoft Word / Google Docs	Structured lore banks, character sheets, emotional tag maps	Use document links or summaries as prompt injections
Wattpad	Serialized lore fragments, reader feedback loops	Export key scenes or tags for emotional regression testing
NovelCrafter	Dedicated authoring tool with modular scene/lore management	Sync lore modules with ASEP pipeline stages
Obsidian / Notion	Markdown-based or block-based knowledge graphs	Use backlinks and tags to simulate memory echo nodes
Custom JSON/YAML Files	Structured data for lore, tags, and payloads	Programmatic recall via API or prompt templates
________________________________________
 Lore as Executable Memory
•	Function Calls: Lore entries are treated as callable functions (e.g., recall[lore:origin_myth]).
•	Tag-Based Retrieval: Emotional tags (e.g., #grief, #betrayal) allow targeted injection of relevant lore.
•	Memory Echo Nodes: Lore fragments are seeded with recursive hooks to reinforce emotional payloads across chapters.
________________________________________
🛠️ Implementation Tips
•	Use chunked summaries of lore documents to stay within token limits.
•	Store emotional payload maps externally and reference them during scene generation.
•	Create prompt templates that dynamically pull from external sources (e.g., “Using the following lore summary, generate a scene where…”).
•	Employ custom agents or tools (like GPTs or plugins) to manage lore injection and tag integrity.
1.	Human-Aided Recursive Revalidation (HARR) Framework

Optimized for Any LLM Environment

⸻

Overview:
Human-Aided Recursive Revalidation (HARR) serves as a manual oversight mechanism during critical plot recalibrations to ensure emotional integrity and prevent narrative drift in LLM-driven storytelling. The methodology is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, including GPT-based models, LLaMA, Claude, and other foundational models.

⸻
Core Components:
Core Components:
1.	Real-Time Divergence Monitoring:
o	Identification of narrative drift during recursive loops, a common issue in autonomous LLM deployments.
o	Alert mechanisms for emotional desynchronization from intended payloads, reducing risks of contextually irrelevant outputs.
o	Automated flagging for manual intervention if divergence exceeds preset thresholds, ensuring narrative coherence.
2.	Manual Revalidation Points:
o	Human intervention checkpoints to recalibrate emotional flow without disrupting user experience.
o	Scripted rollback to Memory Echo Nodes if drift is detected, maintaining storyline integrity.
o	Operator-defined branching logic for emergency restoration of plotline coherence during critical narrative pivots.
3.	Cross-Language Emotional Consistency:
o	Ensuring recursive loops maintain emotional coherence across multilingual deployments.
o	Translation integrity checks during plot realignment to prevent loss of emotional nuance.
o	Adaptive sentiment adjustments for cultural and linguistic differences.
4.	Multithreaded Narrative Stability:
o	Parallel emotional threads are recalibrated simultaneously to prevent desynchronization across interactive branches.
o	Conflict resolution protocols engage automatically during branching conflicts to maintain cohesion.
o	Thread-lock mechanisms prevent narrative overlap in simultaneous multi-user environments.
5.	Ethical Compliance and Sentiment Analysis:
o	Continuous monitoring for narrative manipulation, coercive emotional states, and alignment with ethical storytelling guidelines.
o	Integration with sentiment analysis APIs for real-time emotional health checks.
o	Automated audits to detect emotional loop coercion or manipulative recursion events.
________________________________________
Implementation Strategies:
•	LLM-Agnostic Integration: HARR can be deployed alongside any LLM via API hooks that monitor narrative divergence in real time.
•	Modular Memory Recall: Leveraging LLM memory states, HARR tags emotional checkpoints to enable seamless rollback and recalibration.
•	Operator Dashboard: A live interface for human agents to intervene in real-time, adjust narrative paths, and manage cross-language consistency.
________________________________________
Anticipated Outcomes:
1.	Increased Narrative Stability — Fewer logic breaks and emotional drift in long-form generative storytelling.
2.	Enhanced Cross-Language Integrity — Smoother multilingual transitions without narrative loss.
3.	Ethical Safeguarding — Human oversight ensures manipulative recursion and bias are mitigated.
4.	Real-Time Conflict Resolution — Branching conflicts are detected and resolved without user disruption.
